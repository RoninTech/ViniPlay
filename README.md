ARDO IPTV Player
A simple, self-hosted IPTV player with a clean web interface and powerful backend transcoding using FFMPEG. This project allows you to load M3U playlists and EPG XML files to create a personalized TV guide and stream channels directly in your browser.

The backend server handles stream fetching and on-the-fly transcoding, resolving common browser compatibility and CORS issues.

âœ¨ Features
TV Guide Interface: A clean, responsive EPG (Electronic Program Guide) view.

M3U & EPG Support: Load channels and guide data from local files or remote URLs.

FFMPEG Transcoding: The Node.js backend uses ffmpeg to transcode streams, ensuring broad browser compatibility.

Dockerized: The entire application is bundled into a single, easy-to-deploy Docker image.

Favorites & Recents: Mark your favorite channels and quickly access recently watched ones.

Search: Instantly search through both channels and program listings.

Picture-in-Picture: Continue watching your stream while you browse other tabs.
