## ðŸš€ How to Run

This application is distributed as a Docker image. To run it, you will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system.

1.  **Log in to GitHub Container Registry**

    You first need to authenticate your Docker client with GHCR. You only need to do this once.
    ```bash
    docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
    ```
    > **Note:** You will be prompted for a password. You must use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `read:packages` scope. You can generate one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=read:packages).

2.  **Pull the Docker Image**

    Pull the latest version of the player from the GitHub Container Registry.
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ardo-iptv-player:latest
    ```

3.  **Run the Container**

    Start the container, mapping port `8998` to your host machine.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8998:8998 --name ardovini_tvplayer ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ardo-iptv-player:latest
    ```

Remember to replace **YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME** in the commands above with your actual GitHub username.

Once the container is running, you can access your IPTV player by navigating to **[http://localhost:8998](http://localhost:8998)** in your web browser.
