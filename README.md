ViniPlay transforms your M3U and EPG files into a polished, high-performance streaming experience. It's a full-featured IPTV solution that runs in a Docker container, providing a robust Node.js backend to handle streams and a sleek, responsive frontend for an exceptional user experience.

The server-side backend resolves common CORS and browser compatibility issues by proxying or transcoding streams with FFMPEG, while the feature-rich frontend provides a user experience comparable to premium IPTV services.

## 🚀 Getting Started

ViniPlay is designed for easy deployment using Docker.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ "null")
    
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ "null") (Recommended)
    

### Method 1: Using `docker-compose` (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get started.

1.  **Create Project Files:** Create a directory for your ViniPlay setup and add the following two files:
    
    -   `docker-compose.yml`:
        
        ```
        version: "3.8"
        services:
          viniplay:
            build: .
            container_name: viniplay
            ports:
              - "8998:8998"
            restart: unless-stopped
            volumes:
              - ./viniplay-data:/data
            env_file:
              - ./.env
        
        ```
        
    -   `.env`:
        
        ```
        # Replace this with a long, random, and secret string
        SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_session_key_here
        
        ```
        
        > **Security Note:** Your `SESSION_SECRET` should be a long, random string to properly secure user sessions.
        
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository into the same directory.
    
    ```
    git clone <repository_url> .
    
    ```
    
3.  **Build and Run the Container:** From your project directory, run the following command:
    
    ```
    docker-compose up --build -d
    
    ```

### Method 2: Using `docker`

If you prefer not to use Docker Compose, you can build and run the container manually.

1.  **Build the Image:** From the root of the project directory, run:
    
    ```
    docker build -t viniplay .
    
    ```
    
2.  **Run the Container:** Create a volume directory (`mkdir viniplay-data`) and a `.env` file first. Then run the container:
    
    ```
    docker run -d \
      -p 8998:8998 \
      --name viniplay \
      --env-file ./.env \
      -v "$(pwd)/viniplay-data":/data \
      viniplay
    
    ```
    

### First-Time Setup

Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8998`.

You will be prompted to create your initial **admin account**. This is a one-time setup that secures your instance. After creating the admin account, you can log in and start configuring your sources in the **Settings** tab.

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration is done via the web interface in the **Settings** tab.

-   **Data Sources:** Add your M3U and EPG sources. You can use remote URLs or upload files directly. Activate the sources you want to use and set refresh intervals for URLs to keep data current.
    
-   **Processing:** After adding sources, click the **Process Sources & View Guide** button. This will download, parse, and merge all your data.
    
-   **Player Settings:**
    
    -   **User Agents:** Manage the User-Agent strings sent with stream requests. This can help bypass provider blocks.
        
    -   **Stream Profiles:** Define how `ffmpeg` processes streams. You can use the built-in profiles or create your own custom commands.
        
-   **User Management (Admin):** Admins can create, edit, and delete user accounts from the settings page.
